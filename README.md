# AI Music App

A Flutter application for managing and playing music with voice and gesture controls.

## Features

- **Music Library:** View a list of uploaded songs.
- **Upload Songs:** Add local audio files (e.g., MP3) to the music library.
- **Play Songs:** Play songs from the library.
- **Playback Controls:** Standard controls (Play, Pause, Stop, Next, Previous) available on the Now Playing screen.
- **Voice Commands:** Control playback using voice commands (e.g., "play", "pause", "stop", "next song", "previous song", "play song number X", "hey buddy"). The app uses "hey buddy" as a trigger phrase.
- **Three-Dot Menu:** Options on each song in the library to Delete or Share the song file.
- **Now Playing Screen:** Dedicated screen to view current song details and access playback controls.

## How to Use

6.  **Playback Controls (Voice):** While on the Now Playing screen, say the trigger phrase "Hey buddy", followed by a command like "play", "pause", "stop", "next song", or "previous song". To play a specific song from the library using voice from the library screen, say "play song number X" (replace X with the song number).
7.  **Delete/Share Songs:** In the Music Library, tap the three-dot menu icon next to a song to see options to Delete or Share the song file.
